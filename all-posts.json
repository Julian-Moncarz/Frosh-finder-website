I’m originally from Indonesia and can’t wait to start this new chapter in Toronto. When I’m not diving into science, you’ll probably find me doing something artsy. I love to sing, play both the piano and violin, and I’m constantly surrounded by music — whether I’m performing or just enjoying a good playlist. I also spend time dancing and drawing, which help me recharge and keep my creativity flowing. Also, I’m a proud cat lover — if you ever want to swap cat stories or cute photos, I’m always up for it. Whether you’re passionate about music, science, or just looking to make some friends before the semester starts, feel free to reach out. I’d love to connect! <3 @violeenaisha",

If you asked anyone close to me, they’d tell you my major personality trait is definitely “bad joke factory.” I’m a huge Formula One fan, and passionately follow cricket and tennis. I love baking, and am a huge foodie with a sweet tooth (not the healthiest combination…) I’m a voracious reader, especially if I find a good action/thriller novel or an interesting history book to read. Be warned: I am VERY MUCH a dog person too. I love to walk and explore new places, and can’t wait to do so in Toronto! I am looking for a roommate, if you’re headed to Chestnut and are interested, drop a message. Say hi @aaryanlmfao anytime :)",

I used to play the piano, but have since shifted my focus to the bagpipes (strange switch, ik). I was the drum major for my school’s band. I’ve been playing video games my entire life, playing games like CSGO, Valorant (super rusty/bad in both), Apex (also pretty bad at it), as well as a wide collection of single player games. Other things I’m into are trivia, history (mainly 20th century), photography, backpacking, and I’m trying out bartending. I have two cats named Hua Hua and Pepper, as a well as a turtle named Tom. I want to start going to the gym again (haven’t been regularly since grade 9) so if you wanna be my gym bro, or maybe my friend, hmu @supreme_leader_kevin.",

My name is Ridhwan but you can also call me Rizzwan. I like long walks by the beach… stargazing as we ponder upon the wonders of the unive- I’m playing. I will take you up on the walks by the beach though. I’m from Winnipeg, friendly Manitoba. Some of my hobbies are playing basketball (always ready to defend my skills if needed), volleyball, and cricket watching (take this how you will). I’m definitely an arts kid at heart so I have no idea how I ended up in STEM, but I got in for Comp sci @ Trinity so y’all are missing out on a good one. 😔 But if you like poems, photography, or just long walks by the beach 😍 we can become great friends! Favoruite artists are (not in order), Drake (#1), J Cole (#2), The Weeknd, Ice Spice (I’m a munch 😍), Kendrick, Jhené Aiko, Stromae, Gunna (QPSKIIII), and Future but tbh I dance to anything so as long as it’s not country we can vibe. My favourite bands are AJR, Clean Bandit, Black Eyed Peas. Tbh, this space is too small to talk about everything and anything about me but this is the important stuff to remember: I’m 6’2, look good in a suit, and can salsa. Looking forward to going on long walks by the beachside w y’all when I’m ever in Toronto! 🤩 Or if not at least getting to hear ur experiences about UofT and reaffirming my decision… IG: @ridhwanlaibadmos",

I’m also a fun person to be around with and yes I did bring a cardboard cutout of beomgyu with me to prom. I love video editing, skiing, and hanging out with friends. I play volleyball, badminton, and I used to swim. I also love listening to music and I listen to almost all genres of musics (including kpop), some of my fav artists rn are Taylor Swift, dojo cat, 1nonly, Ariana grande, skz, svt, nct, txt, enha, etc. This is my instagram: @reb_best and this is my snapchat: rebwang, feel free to reach out",

I’m from Hong Kong, and I’ve only been to Toronto once before, so I’m hoping to meet some friends here who can show me around One fact bout me is that I’ve been to four different secondary schools, which has been a bit of a wild ride. I started off in a local government school in Hong Kong, but then I got to go to a boarding school in Gold Coast, Australia. However somehow, I had to come back to Hong Kong due to COVID-19, and I ended up going to the Australian international school here. And since I really wanted to do the IBDP, I switched to another school with better resources. When I’m not studying, I love to sleep, eat good food, play with my cat, dye my hair and party (◐‿◑)� Feel free to dm, always like to meet new friends:D",
