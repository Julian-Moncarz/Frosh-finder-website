My name is Ridhwan but you can also call me Rizzwan. I like long walks by the beach‚Ä¶ stargazing as we ponder upon the wonders of the unive- I‚Äôm playing. I will take you up on the walks by the beach though. I‚Äôm from Winnipeg, friendly Manitoba. Some of my hobbies are playing basketball (always ready to defend my skills if needed), volleyball, and cricket watching (take this how you will). I‚Äôm definitely an arts kid at heart so I have no idea how I ended up in STEM, but I got in for Comp sci @ Trinity so y‚Äôall are missing out on a good one. üòî But if you like poems, photography, or just long walks by the beach üòç we can become great friends! Favoruite artists are (not in order), Drake (#1), J Cole (#2), The Weeknd, Ice Spice (I‚Äôm a munch üòç), Kendrick, Jhen√© Aiko, Stromae, Gunna (QPSKIIII), and Future but tbh I dance to anything so as long as it‚Äôs not country we can vibe. My favourite bands are AJR, Clean Bandit, Black Eyed Peas. Tbh, this space is too small to talk about everything and anything about me but this is the important stuff to remember: I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2, look good in a suit, and can salsa.

I‚Äôve also been awarded the UofT International Scholar Award by the university. Being a foodie, I love to try out new places. I love meeting new people and doing all sorts of crazy things! Golden retrievers make me the happiest but there are short cuts to happiness and dancing is one of them, hence clubbing is going to be an indispensable part of my undergrad life. Shopping is the only kind of therapy I‚Äôm looking forward to. I can literally watch any movie or listen to any kind of music as long as I have great company. Would love to get in touch with you guys. See you soon! Feel free to drop a dm on @katyaynibhatia :)",

I started off in a local government school in Hong Kong, but then I got to go to a boarding school in Gold Coast, Australia. However somehow, I had to come back to Hong Kong due to COVID-19, and I ended up going to the Australian international school here. And since I really wanted to do the IBDP, I switched to another school with better resources.

Hi! my name is Rishi Shashank, a chameleon who can blend into any setting with ease.I‚Äôm from India and committed to UTSG for computer science at Victoria college. From the open road on my motorcycle to the classic charm of vintage items, I have a love for all things old school. But don‚Äôt be fooled by my love for nostalgia - I‚Äôm also a party animal who knows how to have fun and keep the good times rolling. So, come along for the ride and let‚Äôs make some unforgettable memories together! Connect with me - @rishi_shanks",

I spend most of my time outside of school work hanging out with my friends, helping out my school community, watching anime, and sleeping. I am also big musical theatre fan so if you're ever looking for someone to dance and sing your heart out with, I got you üòÇ I'm always down to try out new interests and hobbies because I've always lived in small towns and there's never much to do. You can find me @chickenwing0727 I'd love to make some friends before the school year begins!\"",
