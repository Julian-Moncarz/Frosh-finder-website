I love classic lit and weird magical realism and I’m hoping to publish a book. I love horror games (recently hyperfixated on F2F), reading wikis of indie games with cool lore, and rewatching 6 hour long gameplays. I can name every WDC since 1957 (guess my fav driver) and I loveee cats 🐈 !! Feel free to hmu if you need a concert or bouldering partner @aebrllr",

Pearson scholar here!) — and if you’re curious, i even have a video of my reaction to the acceptance letter in my profile. see you soon! :) @zhqlaman",

I like to cook and learn new recipes to try out, listen to mostly modern music (Daniel Caesar, Bruno Mars, Steve Lacy, Faye Webster), watch anime, play badminton, workout (I need a gym partner), learn about cars, climb, and play dumb Roblox horror games with my friends.

I’ve been admitted to University College at the St. George Campus, where I plan to pursue a degree in the social sciences. My interests range from a major passion for public policy and developmental macroeconomics to world history and politics. I spend most of my time hanging out with friends, listening to music from artists like carti, future, gunna, offset, thug, juicy j, ye, odd future, kid cudi, frank ocean and mac miller, and watching any scorsese or tarantino classic. I’m super excited to begin university and can’t wait to enjoy Toronto to the fullest. @dhruvgadgil",

I’ve lived in Toronto my whole life & will be commuting! About me: I’m a big nerd, I love watching YouTube videos on random stuff about history, science, & philosophy. I also like anime & manga (JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, Vinland Saga, Hunter x Hunter), lifting, reading (currently obsessed with A Song of Ice and Fire), and am trying to learn how to skateboard. As far as music goes, I’m all over the place, but lately I’ve been into 2000-2010’s pop, all sorts of rock, & some electronic, but I’m open minded & appreciate just about every genre! Some artists/bands I like would be Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Led Zepplin, & Fleetwood Mac. I’m really talkative and love to meet new people so please reach out if you ever wanna chat or if we have any similar interests or anything!! IG: james_vi0la",

He's so cool, and handsome, and cool\" so here's a little intro since you're obviously dying to get to know my personality too: My main hobbies are ruling England, being the first man on the moon (your history books lied to you), seducing rich chicks on sinking ships, and helping all the poor stepmoms that are stuck in washing machines. Im a very busy guy, but even a guy as awesome as me needs a break, so when I'm not saving puppies from wildfires, you can find me chillin' in my swamp or winning Mr Olympia contests. I love meeting new people, so if you're a rich girl on a sinking ship, a step mom stuck in a washing machine, or you just like meeting new people too, hmu at @undercover_dentist",

I love watching movies, hanging out with my friends, listening to music, (I’ll listen to anything except for country), doing/trying different makeup looks and baking. Rn some of my favourite artists are Tyler the Creator, Mäneskin, Djo, and The Smiths. I asked a couple of my friends to describe me and they said: caring, thoughtful, funny, and fashionable. (Awww thanks guys 🫶🏾✨) I alr know a couple of students but I’m always down to meet new people! ✨ hmu @jo.rdyn_spam902",

My name is Ridhwan but you can also call me Rizzwan. I like long walks by the beach… stargazing as we ponder upon the wonders of the unive- I’m playing. I will take you up on the walks by the beach though. I’m from Winnipeg, friendly Manitoba. Some of my hobbies are playing basketball (always ready to defend my skills if needed), volleyball, and cricket watching (take this how you will). I’m definitely an arts kid at heart so I have no idea how I ended up in STEM, but I got in for Comp sci @ Trinity so y’all are missing out on a good one. 😔 But if you like poems, photography, or just long walks by the beach 😍 we can become great friends! Favoruite artists are (not in order), Drake (#1), J Cole (#2), The Weeknd, Ice Spice (I’m a munch 😍), Kendrick, Jhené Aiko, Stromae, Gunna (QPSKIIII), and Future but tbh I dance to anything so as long as it’s not country we can vibe. My favourite bands are AJR, Clean Bandit, Black Eyed Peas. Tbh, this space is too small to talk about everything and anything about me but this is the important stuff to remember: I’m 6’2, look good in a suit, and can salsa. Looking forward to going on long walks by the beachside w y’all when I’m ever in Toronto! 🤩 Or if not at least getting to hear ur experiences about UofT and reaffirming my decision… IG: @ridhwanlaibadmos",

My MBTI is probably/potentially/hypothetically an introvert ENTP (yeah that totally makes sense to me). My favorite quote is “Do not go gentle into that good night… Rage, rage against the dying of the light.” Also, I’m definitely looking for a geek roommate if I can’t get a single room (I’m a New College resident). I know a little bit of everything (just a tiny mini bit). I don’t party a lot unless you’re saying going to CVPR for an entire day. By the way, all six pictures are of me.

I got admitted to UTSG Life Sciences and membership to Woodsworth college, and am so excited to begin my journey there! I love water colouring, watching k-dramas, baking, and trying new food🫶🍰🍦. A fun fact about me is that was I was younger, I was obsessed with bananas. I used to make my friends each grab me a free banana from school breakfast and then eat 3 bananas for breakfast everyday 🍌. Something else about me is I have a twin sister who is also my best friend, but she will be studying elsewhere next year so im looking for a replacement best friend😇. If you see me next fall, please come up and chat with me so we may become great friends! Instagram: @exella_tom3",
