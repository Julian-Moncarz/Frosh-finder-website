Some might call me a far-left lunatic (guess why I’m leaving the US) and I’d love to meet likeminded friends, although I’m definitely an open-minded person.\n\nI am also a huge fan of music. I love metal, punk, and generally anything thats heavy. I play guitar, and write and release music as a hobby. My favorite place to go out is a concert, especially local ones. Def looking for people to nerd out about music with, and buddies to play music with and go to concerts with.\n\nFeel free to dm me, I love meeting new people of all kinds!\n\nig: @ayaanzkazmi \nsnap: azkazmi25",

I’ve lived in Toronto my whole life & will be commuting!\n\nAbout me: I’m a big nerd, I love watching YouTube videos on random stuff about history, science, & philosophy. I also like anime & manga (JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, Vinland Saga, Hunter x Hunter), lifting, reading (currently obsessed with A Song of Ice and Fire), and am trying to learn how to skateboard. As far as music goes, I’m all over the place, but lately I’ve been into 2000-2010’s pop, all sorts of rock, & some electronic, but I’m open minded & appreciate just about every genre! Some artists/bands I like would be Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Led Zepplin, & Fleetwood Mac. \n\nI’m really talkative and love to meet new people so please reach out if you ever wanna chat or if we have any similar interests or anything!!\n\nIG: james_vi0la",

My name is Ridhwan but you can also call me Rizzwan. I like long walks by the beach… stargazing as we ponder upon the wonders of the unive- I’m playing. I will take you up on the walks by the beach though. \n\nI’m from Winnipeg, friendly Manitoba. Some of my hobbies are playing basketball (always ready to defend my skills if needed), volleyball, and cricket watching (take this how you will). \n\nI’m definitely an arts kid at heart so I have no idea how I ended up in STEM, but I got in for Comp sci @ Trinity so y’all are missing out on a good one. 😔  But if you like poems, photography, or just long walks by the beach 😍 we can become great friends!\n\nFavoruite artists are (not in order), Drake (#1), J Cole (#2), The Weeknd, Ice Spice (I’m a munch 😍), Kendrick, Jhené Aiko, Stromae, Gunna (QPSKIIII), and Future but tbh I dance to anything so as long as it’s not country we can vibe. \n\nMy favourite bands are AJR, Clean Bandit, Black Eyed Peas. \n\nTbh, this space is too small to talk about everything and anything about me but this is the important stuff to remember: I’m 6’2, look good in a suit, and can salsa. \n\nLooking forward to going on long walks by the beachside w y’all when I’m ever in Toronto! 🤩 Or if not at least getting to hear ur experiences about UofT and reaffirming my decision… IG: @ridhwanlaibadmos",

I’ll be pursuing an undergraduate degree in flute performance. \nBesides music, I love crocheting (you might be able to tell in some of my photos). I’m a bit of an addict at this point😂! Sometimes I post some of the things I’ve made so far on my account @kindredspiritcrochet. I also enjoy anything to do with history, visiting museums, practicing ballet, modelling, attending (or performing in) live concerts, storytelling, and travelling. \nI’m super excited to experience uni life at its core in the fall!🙂 feel free to DM me if you’re also going to UofT 😁 perhaps we’ll end up in the same class \n@anne_when",

I started off in a local government school in Hong Kong, but then I got to go to a boarding school in Gold Coast, Australia. However somehow, I had to come back to Hong Kong due to COVID-19, and I ended up going to the Australian international school here. And since I really wanted to do the IBDP, I switched to another school with better resources.\n\nWhen I’m not studying, I love to sleep, eat good food, play with my cat, dye my hair and party (◐‿◑)�\n\nFeel free to dm, always like to meet new friends:D",

I spend most of my time outside of school work hanging out with my friends, helping out my school community, watching anime, and sleeping. I am also big musical theatre fan so if you're ever looking for someone to dance and sing your heart out with, I got you 😂 I'm always down to try out new interests and hobbies because I've always lived in small towns and there's never much to do. \n \nYou can find me @chickenwing0727 I'd love to make some friends before the school year begins!\"",
