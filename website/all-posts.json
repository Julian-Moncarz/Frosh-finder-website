Some might call me a far-left lunatic (guess why I’m leaving the US) and I’d love to meet likeminded friends, although I’m definitely an open-minded person.\n\nI am also a huge fan of music. I love metal, punk, and generally anything thats heavy. I play guitar, and write and release music as a hobby. My favorite place to go out is a concert, especially local ones. Def looking for people to nerd out about music with, and buddies to play music with and go to concerts with.\n\nFeel free to dm me, I love meeting new people of all kinds!\n\nig: @ayaanzkazmi \nsnap: azkazmi25",

I’ve lived in Toronto my whole life & will be commuting!\n\nAbout me: I’m a big nerd, I love watching YouTube videos on random stuff about history, science, & philosophy. I also like anime & manga (JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, Vinland Saga, Hunter x Hunter), lifting, reading (currently obsessed with A Song of Ice and Fire), and am trying to learn how to skateboard. As far as music goes, I’m all over the place, but lately I’ve been into 2000-2010’s pop, all sorts of rock, & some electronic, but I’m open minded & appreciate just about every genre! Some artists/bands I like would be Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Led Zepplin, & Fleetwood Mac. \n\nI’m really talkative and love to meet new people so please reach out if you ever wanna chat or if we have any similar interests or anything!!\n\nIG: james_vi0la",
